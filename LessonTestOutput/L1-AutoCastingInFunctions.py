# Some functions are built to handle inputs of different types
# For example the previous code we ran , print(a * b), automatically converted a number to a string
# The + function will do mathematical operations if all variables are numbers
# In the case of both an int and a float being supplied the result will be a float

d = 3
e = 2.5

print(d + e)

# If 1 variable is a string and another is a number we will need to cast the number to a string
# python LessonTestOutput/L1-AutoCastingInFunctions.py

print("I like " + str(d) + " slices of bacon in my Brandon soup")
